# ACL for shared views
# Example:
#acl:
#  - name: PedidosYa
#    domain: pedidosya.com # this is the catch-all domain, all users that belong to this domain
#                          # will have access to all the countries defined below
#                          # `domain` can be `null`, in this case the permissions are granted
#                          # based on the contents of `users`
#    countries: [ar, bo, cl, cr, pa, uy]       # Required: Filter rows by country_code
#                                                If it is null (`~`) no filters are applied (all entities)
#    entities: [PY_AR]                         # Required: Filter rows by entity_id if `filter_by_entity` is true
#                                                If it is null (`~`) no filters are applied (all entities)
#                                              IMPORTANT - you can only filter by entites if counties are specified
#                                              as well (not null)
#    users:                                    # Optional field
#      - group: bi_logistics@pedidosya.com     # `group` is a google group
#      - email: riccardo.bini@deliveryhero.com # `email` overrides the configuration of the venture
#        countries: [de]                       # `countries` is optional, if omitted the countries of the venture will be used
