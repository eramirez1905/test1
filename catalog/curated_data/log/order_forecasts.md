| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| country_code | `STRING` | A two-character alphanumeric code based on the code of the country as specified by ISO 3166-1 ALPHA-2. |
| created_date | `DATE` | Time when the forecast was created, i.e. the job was run (in UTC) cast to date. |
| zone_id | `INTEGER` | The numeric identifier assigned to the zone. This id is generated within the central logistics systems and is only unique within the same country. |
| model_name | `STRING` | Name of the prediction model <ul><li> rooster: current production model, ensemble of different time series prediction models like ARIMA & exponential smoothing with different parameters sets, tbats/bats, naive time series decomposition, feed forward single layer neural net. <li> rooster_adjusted: adjusted forecast. <li> others: tbd.  |
| timezone | `STRING` | The name of the timezone where the city is located. The timezone enables time conversion, from UTC to local time. |
| [forecasts](#forecasts) | `ARRAY<RECORD>` | Forecast records. | 

## Forecasts

| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| created_at | `TIMESTAMP` | Time when the forecast was created, i.e. the job was run (in UTC). |
| forecast_for | `TIMESTAMP` | Timestamp (in UTC) of the prediction (30 minute time bin). | 
| forecast_for_local | `DATETIME` | Timestamp (in local time) of the prediction (30 minute time bin). | 
| orders | `FLOAT` | Amount of predicted orders for this specific 30 minute time bin. | 
| is_valid | `BOOLEAN` | Flag to indicate if the forecast is still valid, i.e. if the zone geometry has been changed after the forecast was created. This might render the forecast useless, hence is_valid will be false. | 
| is_most_recent | `BOOLEAN` | Flag to to indicate if the forecast is most recent or if a more recent forecast exists. | 
| [riders_demand](#riders-demand) | `ARRAY<RECORD>` | Records containing riders demand on 15 minutes level. As rider demand is generated by Rooster based on forecasts, this array is only filled for `rooster` and `rooster_adjusted` models. |

## Riders Demand
| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| starting_point_id | `INTEGER`| Id of starting point the demand is associated to. |
| demand_for_local | `NUMERIC` | Timestamp (in local time) of the needed demand (15 minute time bin). | 
| riders_needed | `NUMERIC` | Riders demand for this specific 15 minute time bin. | 
| no_shows_expected | `NUMERIC` | The forecasted no shows for this specific 15 minute time bin. |
