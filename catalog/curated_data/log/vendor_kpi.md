# Vendor KPI (Beta) 

## Table structure may change without any prior notice, use at your own risk.

The Vendor KPI table is meant to contains all Vendor level Performance metrics in absolute numbers only (i.e. Metrics in % or ratio will not be included, e.g. % Fail-rate ). The KPIs are aggregated on hourly level for each vendor, and the 'DATE' and `DATETIME` type columns are stored in local timezone. Time-related fields are displayed in seconds. Distance-related fields are displayed in meters.

| at_vendor_time_cleaned_sum | `INTEGER` | The total time in seconds the rider stays at the vendor but computed from the time food should have been picked up (expected time food should have been ready). Not computed if rider is late > 10 mins to allow possible re-cooking of the food. | Avg. At vendor time - Cleaned (min) = (at_vendor_time_cleaned_sum / 60) / at_vendor_time_cleaned_count |

| cross_border_orders | `INTEGER` | The total number of orders crossing 2 or more zones. | % Cross Border orders = cross_border_orders / (successful_orders + cancelled_orders) |
| reliable_rate_n | `INTEGER` | The total number of orders which is counted as reliable from the vendor side. Reliability is computed as the difference between vendor late and rider late in minutes. If this difference is below 5 minutes then the vendor is considered as reliable. | Reliability Rate = reliable_rate_n / reliable_rate_d |
| reliable_rate_d | `INTEGER` | The total number of orders where the reliability rate can be calculated. | |
| city_market_share | `FLOAT` | The total orders of the vendor over the total orders within it's city (timeframe past 4 weeks). | |
| running_total | `INTEGER` | The running total of orders for the past 4 weeks within vendor's city. | % Vendor running total = running_total / city_total |
| city_total | `INTEGER` | The total of orders for the past 4 weeks within vendor's city. | |
| city_decile | `INTEGER` | The decile position of the vendor in terms of total orders in descending order in its city. | |
| country_centile | `INTEGER` | The centile position of the vendor in terms of total orders in descending order in its country. | |

### Examples (only for KPIs in OWN DELIVERIES scope):
**Important : The vendor_kpi table is partitioned by `created_date_local`. For query efficiency reason, please always consider to put this field in the WHERE clauses.**
