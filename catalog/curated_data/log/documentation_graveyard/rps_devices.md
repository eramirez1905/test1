| Column | Type | Description | Categories |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| region | `STRING` | The region assigned to the country of the vendor. | ap, eu, kr, mena and us |
| service | `STRING` | The service generating this particular row of record. | DMS |
| mdm_service | `STRING` | The Mobile Devices Management solution applied to the device. | SOTI or MOBILOCK |
| created_date | `DATE` | The partition column. The date when this row of record is generated by its service (e.g. DMS). | |
| assigned_at | `TIMESTAMP` | The timestamp when the device is assigned to the vendor. | |
| updated_at | `TIMESTAMP` | The timestamp of the latest change in any device information. | | 
| country_code | `STRING` | A two-character alphanumeric code based on the country of the vendor as specified by ISO 3166-1 ALPHA-2. | ae, ar, at, au, ba, etc |
| device_id | `STRING` | The universal unique identifier for the device within RPS. It is generated by the RPS Clients (GoDroid & GoWin) and stored in DMS. With `region` altogether, it can be used as joining key with the other CL tables, e.g. `cl.rps_device_events`. | |
| serial_number | `STRING` | The serial number of the device used by the vendor. | |
| private_uuid | `STRING` | The device unique identifier. | |
| is_active | `BOOLEAN` | A flag stating if the device is active, information generated by the RPS services or MDM services. | |
| is_in_rps_services | `BOOLEAN` | A flag stating if the device exists in RPS services. If a device can be found in MDM solutions but not in RPS services, the record can still be found in the table but with this flag being `FALSE`. | |
| is_in_mdm | `BOOLEAN` | A flag stating if the device is on any MDM solutions (i.e. SOTI MobiControl, or Mobilock). If a device exists in RPS services but not in MDM solutions, the record can still be found in the table but with this flag being `FALSE`. | |
| is_the_latest_version | `BOOLEAN` | A flag stating if this row of record describes the latest status of the device. | |
| is_ngt_device | `BOOLEAN` | A flag stating if this device is an NGT (Next Generation Transmission) device. The definition of NGT is that the device is SUNMI V2 device with SOTI as the MDM service. | |
| vendor_id | `INTEGER` | The identifier of a physical vendor within RPS. Only unique within the same `region`. To get a unique id of a record, concatenation of `region` and `vendor_id` is suggested. | |
| entity_id | `STRING` | The code of the local operational entity representing the country. This code is made out of two codes : the two-letter code of the venture, and the country iso. | AP_PA, AR_HU, BK_DE, BK_SG, BO_CA, etc |
| vendor_code | `STRING` | The identifier of the vendor that is sent from the platform (e.g. Foodpanda) to the RPS systems. It is specific to the vendor within a platform. | |s
| [hardware](#Hardware) | `RECORD` | The information related to hardware. | |
| [os](#OS) | `RECORD` | The information related to OS on the device. | |
| [client](#Client) | `RECORD` | The information related to RPS Clients (i.e. GoDroid & GoWin). | |
